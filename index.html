        <h1>To My Dearest Evgenia,</h1>
        <p class="letter">
            My beloved Evgenia;
            (first of all please hit the play button)
            365. 365 days ago today, in this hour, I told the biggest truth off my chest. I confessed my never told desires, my never shared love. A year ago, today you became mines. We became each otherâ€™s. Words gained new meanings. My sentences then formed poems for you. 
            Itâ€™s the 365th day of my never-ending love for you. Itâ€™s the first anniversary of our many others to come. We became strangers to soulmates, lovers to fiancÃ©s in the past year. And soon itâ€™ll be our 3rd year together when itâ€™s finally 2025.  
            
            My beautiful;
            I never had a longer lasting dream, nor a never-ending smile and never thought Iâ€™d get so lucky with a person like you. Prettier than moon itself, brightest star in the endless space above, my beautiful Evgenia you are the most gorgeous mark of God in this earth. 
            
            My dearest Evgenia,
            Every moment with you has been a gift, every smile of yours a treasure I hold dear. You have brought warmth into the coldest corners of my soul, and your presence is the melody that my heart beats to. The way your laughter fills the silence is my favourite symphony, a sound I could listen to for a lifetime. Each day, I wake up with gratitude for you, and every night, I thank the stars for bringing us together. You are my inspiration, my strength, and my sanctuary, the reason I strive to be a better man. In your eyes, I see not just the present but the brightest future I could ever imagine. The love we share is a testament to the beauty of fate, and I promise to cherish it with all that I am. With every passing day, my love for you grows deeper, like roots firmly planted in rich, fertile soil. As we celebrate today, I look forward to a lifetime of firsts, of anniversaries, and of memories made by your side. You are my everything, Evgenia, and forever isnâ€™t long enough to show you how much you mean to me.
            
            You are the prettiest, kindest, smartest, funniest and the cutest little thing Iâ€™ve ever seen and will ever see. Your eyes are my favourite painting. Your lips are my favourite flavour.  Your skin is my favourite tone. Your voice is my favourite instrument. Your arms are my favourite pillows. Your words are my favourite poems. But you 	Evgenia, you are my favourite. Who you are is my favourite thing in this world. Your silly jokes, your giggles, your reactions, your thoughtfulness and kindness... I love who you are with all of you baby.
            
            Hey my shining star, my greatest desire, my only wish, my blessing, my heaven in this world. Hey Evgenia. I want to confess you something again. Something you already know, something I hope to be true, something I wished in my last lives, something I felt for the past year and more now. Something that hasnâ€™t been any less, something that never felt more real, something that didnâ€™t stop growing, something Iâ€™m sure that wonâ€™t ever end. I want you to know how much I love you, how you ruin my sleep schedule in the most amazing and adorable way, how you make me on top of to moon, above everyone else, how you make me feel so loved that I would never imagine.  I want you to know I am in love with you, that Iâ€™ll never stop loving you. That I enjoy you more than anything and Iâ€™ll never ever get bored of you. I want you to know that being dein Mustafa is the best thing that happened to me in my life, and will ever stay so. 
            
            I love you so much my Evgenia

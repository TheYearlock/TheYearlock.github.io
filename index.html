                My pretty Evgenia;

It's been more than 300 days since we became each others. And i regret not telling you i loved you soone than i did. I can't believe we met and we held hands. CUS WDYM WE KNOW EACH OTHER FOR A YEAR.  And more then anything i'm so glad i decided to be move curious about your life. I like how our lives are so different yet so similar,  I love how we can relate to things we go through.
You always make ne smile when im talking with you, and the pretty feeling in my lungs never weit away since: fell in love with you. My pretty, i know; call gar pretty reguraly, but thats what you are. Pretty. Prettiest girl, and you're only for me.  I actually very much missed writing to you. My gorgeous baby, i was it sure what to get you.I first thought i'd get you earphones, but then i wented to get you a pink flipphone,  but as you can see i got you (us) a hemera so you (we) could make cute photos together. And i just know you will take photos of the cats with that. 

My adorable thing, sometimes when you get jealous over me i kinda like it. And yes you are as jealous as me My pretty baby :3  I still have the cute videos of you, you sent with the cats, and i still watch them if i get the chance. Right now i'm in Japanese lessen but i dont care. I deleted so many sentences and started over like 3 times. Because 1 want it to be perfect. But i still don't know how i can express my -feelings towards you as how i am feeling right now baby.

I miss looking at your prettiness from 10 CM's far. I miss feeling your hand in mines. I miss your sweat and your eyes. I wish we had more time together, i wish we kissed more, i wish i could hold you more. I  miss your deep looks at me, i wanted to kiss you everytime you looked at me. 

When we started talking much i knew we "clicked' together, and a year later, right now, it's safe to say that i was right :3 You were so cute back then too which made me want to talk to you more and more.  You make me smile every single second my pretty.

You always said you found my life interesting when your life won for more interesting then mines. I still don't understand why you lied and didnt tell me about your step -dad but i guess you got worried about something. And you are for more colourfull than me my pretty :3

Yes i do write this letter for more than one day, and im still not sure if its good enough to send you. But i dont have enough time left to write it again beacause i have to code the website aswell.

My pretty baby we seen each other (heard mostly...) in our most secret situations. At least you did. And you are mines together so i wish you can be more comfortable and less shy with me my pretty.

You are the prettiest little girl i've ever seen. I know i say it all the time but its just the truth, your pretty hair smelled so good. and now when i compare your hair from a year ago i think long hair suits you very well :3 And the way you looked at me with your pretty litte eyes was so attractive my pretty one. and the way your lips purse together is so so cute:3 i love it when you snap me looking so silly like that.

You are the most prettiest little girl and im so glad you are my prettiest litte girl. im so glad you are mine. you look so astonishing from the moment you wake up until you go sleep. you look especially so good when you are sleepy, your voice becomes so soft and i love it so much. You're my pretty little girl Evgenia. your little ears, your little chin, your fluffy cheeks make me so insane every single time i think about them. my adorable, your body is like a sculpture i want to worship to. I used to believe all ancient greeks was so stupid to believe in a single women who was so pretty to make one to do anything, now i understand how that is possible, i understand it more whenever i see you. I want to do anything that makes you happy because you are the most perfect thing ever existed for me. 

I never stopped missing you since the last moment you left my lips. "Wenn ich ihren Mund verließ, Dann fing ich an zu frier'n". i wish rammstein meant lips touching by this but its what i mean here baby. i miss you so much with every single part of me, i miss you so much with every second and with every thought.

I love how you started to share everything with me. You have no idea. I love the fact that i know everything in your life. GIRL I JUST ASKED YOU IF I KNOW EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU DIDNT GET WHY I ASKED YOU AND YOU KEPT ASKING IF SOMETHING WAS WRING OMG YOURE SO SILLT ILL EAT YOU MMAMAMMAMAMAMMAMAMA anyways :3 i promised id be back in 11 minutes

my prettiest lover;
i am so glad you were born, i am so glad i met you, i am so glad i confessed and i am so glad we are eachothers forever. You will forever stay the only thing i truly loved and wont ever refret. I hope all your birthdays until now will be with me (it better be) and i hope i'll be able to tell you how much i love you every single time.
I love you so so much my gorgeous. i actually love you the most and i will keep loving you forever. i dont want to imagine that you're gone from my life, i dont want to imagine you're living without me. all i want to imagine is you baby. I am forever yours like how you are forever and ever mines
Happy Birthday My Pretty Evgenia ♥
